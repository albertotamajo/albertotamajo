I am an outstanding third-year MEng Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence student at the University
of Southampton. I was the recipient of the Netcraft Prize during my first academic year as I ranked in the
top 10 computer science cohort at the University of Southampton. I was granted the DAAD RISE Germany
Scholarship the following year and the ECS Undergraduate Research Scholarship during my third
academic year to conduct research on AI at the Mainz University of Applied Sciences and the University
of Southampton, respectively. I strongly believe that AI will be the next step in human evolution, and as
such, I would like to contribute to this cause. However, if we really want to build a machine on the verge
of human-level intelligence, we need to ditch current statistical and data-driven learning paradigm in
favour of a causal-based approach.
