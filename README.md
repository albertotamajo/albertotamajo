### Hi there 👋

I am an outstanding third-year MEng Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence student at the [University of Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/).
I was the recipient of the **Netcraft Prize** during my first academic year as I ranked in the
top 10 computer science cohort at the University of Southampton. I was granted the [DAAD RISE Germany
Scholarship](https://www.daad.de/rise/en/rise-germany/)the following year and the ECS Undergraduate Research Scholarship during my third
academic year to conduct research on AI at the [Mainz University of Applied Sciences](https://www.hs-mainz.de/) and the University
of Southampton, respectively. I strongly believe that AI will be the next step in human evolution, and as
such, I would like to contribute to this cause. However, if we really want to build a machine on the verge
of human-level intelligence, we need to ditch current statistical and data-driven learning paradigm in
favour of a causal-based approach.
